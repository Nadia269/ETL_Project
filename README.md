# Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes climate change by examining historical Earth surface temperature data. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies in temperature changes over time and across different regions. By leveraging SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), this project processes and manages the data, while Power BI is used for comprehensive visualization of the results.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** Used for querying, managing, and analyzing the Earth surface temperature data stored in a relational database.
- **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS):** Employed for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to clean, transform, and load the data into the SQL database.
- **Power BI:** Utilized for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to better understand and communicate the insights derived from the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data]available on Kaggle. It contains temperature data from various locations worldwide, spanning several centuries, and includes information on land and ocean surface temperatures.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preparation:** The raw data was first cleaned and transformed using SSIS, ensuring consistency and removing any anomalies. The cleaned data was then loaded into a SQL Server database for further analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** Queries were written in SSMS to analyze the data, identifying trends in temperature changes over time, detecting patterns in different geographical regions, and understanding seasonal variations.
- **Visualization:** Power BI was used to create visualizations, including time series graphs, and geographical maps, to provide a clear and insightful view of the analysis results.
